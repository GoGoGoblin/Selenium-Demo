Sample Selenium program with Java8, JUnit and Maven

This is my first attempt to create Selenium Web UI test suite with Java8, JUnit, and Maven.

Page Object Model (POM) is used to separate each page object from a main test program executed by JUnit. POM increases readability, maintainability, and extendability of the code.

The program reads test data and expected results from an external Excel file.

Selenium with Java is far more stable than Selenium with C# since Selenium itself is written in Java.
